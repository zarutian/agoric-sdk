/**
 * Use the `details` function as a template literal tag to create
 * informative error messages. The assertion functions take such messages
 * as optional arguments:
 * ```js
 * assert(sky.isBlue(), details`${sky.color} should be "blue"`);
 * ```
 * The details template tag returns an object that can print itself with the
 * formatted message in two ways. It will report the real details to the
 * console but include only the typeof information in the thrown error
 * to prevent revealing secrets up the exceptional path. In the example
 * above, the thrown error may reveal only that `sky.color` is a string,
 * whereas the same diagnostic printed to the console reveals that the
 * sky was green.
 *
 * WARNING: this function currently returns an unhardened result, as hardening
 * proved to cause significant performance degradation.  Consequently, callers
 * should take care to use it only in contexts where this lack of hardening
 * does not present a hazard.  In current usage, a `details` template literal
 * may only appear either as an argument to `assert`, where we know hardening
 * won't matter, or inside another hardened object graph, where hardening is
 * already ensured.  However, there is currently no means to enfoce these
 * constraints, so users are required to employ this function with caution.
 * Our intent is to eventually have a lint rule that will check for
 * inappropriate uses or find an alternative means of implementing `details`
 * that does not encounter the performance issue.  The final disposition of
 * this is being discussed and tracked in issue #679 in the agoric-sdk
 * repository.
