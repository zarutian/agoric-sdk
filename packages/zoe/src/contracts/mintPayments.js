/**
 * This is a very simple contract that creates a new issuer and mints payments
 * from it, in order to give an example of how that can be done.  This contract
 * sends new tokens to anyone who requests them.
 *
 * Offer safety is not enforced here: the expectation is that most contracts
 * that want to do something similar would use the ability to mint new payments
 * internally rather than sharing that ability widely as this one does.
 *
 * makeInstance returns an invitation that, when exercised, provides 1000 of the
 * new tokens. await E(publicAPI).makeInvite() returns an invitation that accepts an
 * empty offer and provides 1000 tokens.
