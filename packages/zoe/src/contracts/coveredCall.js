/**
 * In a covered call, a digital asset's owner sells a call
 * option. A call option is the right to buy the digital asset at a
 * pre-determined price, called the strike price. The call option has an expiry
 * date, when the contract will be cancelled.
 *
 * In this contract, the expiry date is the deadline when
 * the offer escrowing the underlying assets is cancelled.
 * Therefore, the proposal for the underlying assets must have an
 * exit record with the key "afterDeadline".
 *
 * The invite received by the covered call creator is the call option. It has
 * this additional information in the invite's value:
 * { expirationDate, timerAuthority, underlyingAsset, strikePrice }
 *
 * The initial proposal should be:
 * {
 *   give: { UnderlyingAsset: assetAmount },
 *   want: { StrikePrice: priceAmount  },
 *   exit: { afterDeadline: { deadline: time, timer: timer } },
 * }
 * The result of the initial offer is { payout, outcome }, where payout will
 * eventually resolve to the strikePrice, and outcome is an assayable invitation
 * to buy the underlying asset. Since the contract provides assurance that the
 * underlying asset is available on the specified terms, the invite itself can
 * be traded as a valuable good.
