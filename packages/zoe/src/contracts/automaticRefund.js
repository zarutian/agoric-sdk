 * This is a very trivial contract to explain and test Zoe.
 * AutomaticRefund just gives you back what you put in.
 * AutomaticRefund tells Zoe to complete the
 * offer, which gives the user their payout through Zoe. Other
 * contracts will use these same steps, but they will have more
 * sophisticated logic and interfaces.
 *
 * Since the contract doesn't attempt any reallocation, the offer can contain
 * anything in `give` and `want`. The amount in `give` will be returned, and
 * `want` will be ignored.
