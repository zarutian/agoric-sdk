/**

 *
 * Zoe provides a framework for deploying and working with smart

 * that enforces offer safety for the contracts that use it. Zoe has a
 * single `invitationIssuer` for the entirety of its lifetime. By
 * having a reference to Zoe, a user can get the `invitationIssuer`
 * and thus validate any `invitation` they receive from someone else.
 *
 * Zoe has two different facets: the public Zoe service and the
 * contract facet (ZCF). Each contract instance has a copy of ZCF
 * within its vat. The contract and ZCF never have direct access to
 * the users' payments or the Zoe purses.
