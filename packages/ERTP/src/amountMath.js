/**
 * Amounts describe digital assets. From an amount, you can learn the
 * kind of digital asset as well as "how much" or "how many". Amounts
 * have two parts: a brand (the kind of digital asset) and the value
 * (the answer to "how much"). For example, in the phrase "5 bucks",
 * "bucks" takes the role of the brand and the value is 5. Amounts
 * can describe fungible and non-fungible digital assets. Amounts are
 * pass-by-copy and can be made by and sent to anyone.
 *
 * The issuer has an internal table that maps purses and payments to
 * amounts. The issuer must be able to do things such as add digital
 * assets to a purse and withdraw digital assets from a purse. To do
 * so, it must know how to add and subtract digital assets. Rather
 * than hard-coding a particular solution, we chose to parameterize
 * the issuer with a collection of polymorphic functions, which we
 * call `amountMath`. These math functions include concepts like
 * addition, subtraction, and greater than or equal to.
 *
 * We also want to make sure there is no confusion as to what kind of
 * asset we are using. Thus, amountMath includes checks of the
 * `brand`, the unique identifier for the type of digital asset. If
 * the wrong brand is used in amountMath, an error is thrown and the
 * operation does not succeed.
 *
 * amountMath uses mathHelpers to do most of the work, but then adds
 * the brand to the result. The function `value` gets the value from
 * the amount by removing the brand (amount -> value), and the function
 * `make` adds the brand to produce an amount (value -> amount). The
 * function `coerce` takes an amount and checks it, returning an amount (amount
 * -> amount).
 *
 * `makeAmountMath` takes in a brand and the kind of amountMath to use.
 *
 * amountMath is not pass-by-copy, but everything it does can be done
 * locally in each vat that needs the functionality. If the operations
 * are done against a remote version, they have the same semantics, but
 * require an extra messaging round-trip per call. The best way to use
 * it is to make a local copy, which can be done by calling
 * makeLocalAmountMath(issuer).
 *
 * AmountMath exports MathKind, which contains constants for the kinds:
 * NAT, SET, and STRING_SET.
 *
 * Each issuer of digital assets has an associated brand in a one-to-one
 * mapping. In untrusted contexts, such as in analyzing payments and
 * amounts, we can get the brand and find the issuer which matches the
 * brand. The issuer and the brand mutually validate each other.
 *
 * @param {Brand} brand
 * @param {AmountMathKind} amountMathKind
 * @returns {AmountMath}
