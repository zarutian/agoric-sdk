/**
 * @typedef {Object} Issuer
 * The issuer cannot mint a new amount, but it can create empty purses and

 * combining payments, burning payments, and claiming payments
 * exclusively). The issuer should be gotten from a trusted source and
 * then relied upon as the decider of whether an untrusted payment is valid.
 *
 * @property {() => Brand} getBrand Get the Brand for this Issuer. The Brand indicates the kind of
 * digital asset and is shared by the mint, the issuer, and any purses
 * and payments of this particular kind. The brand is not closely
 * held, so this function should not be trusted to identify an issuer
 * alone. Fake digital assets and amount can use another issuer's brand.
 *
 * @property {() => string} getAllegedName Get the allegedName for this mint/issuer
 * @property {() => AmountMath} getAmountMath Get the AmountMath for this Issuer.
 * @property {() => string} getMathHelpersName Get the name of the MathHelpers for this Issuer.
 * @property {() => Purse} makeEmptyPurse Make an empty purse of this brand.
 * @property {(payment: PaymentP) => Promise<boolean>} isLive
 * Return true if the payment continues to exist.
 *
 * If the payment is a promise, the operation will proceed upon resolution.
 *
 * @property {(payment: PaymentP) => Promise<Amount>} getAmountOf
 * Get the amount of digital assets in the payment. Because the
 * payment is not trusted, we cannot call a method on it directly,
 * and must use the issuer instead.
 *
 * If the payment is a promise, the operation will proceed upon resolution.
 *
 * @property {(payment: PaymentP, optAmount?: Amount) => Promise<Amount>} burn
 * Burn all of the digital assets in the payment. `optAmount` is optional.
 * If `optAmount` is present, the code will insist that the amount of
 * the digital assets in the payment is equal to `optAmount`, to
 * prevent sending the wrong payment and other confusion.
 *
 * If the payment is a promise, the operation will proceed upon resolution.
 *
 * @property {(payment: PaymentP, optAmount?: Amount) => Promise<Payment>} claim
 * Transfer all digital assets from the payment to a new payment and
 * delete the original. `optAmount` is optional.
 * If `optAmount` is present, the code will insist that the amount of
 * digital assets in the payment is equal to `optAmount`, to prevent
 * sending the wrong  payment and other confusion.
 *
 * If the payment is a promise, the operation will proceed upon resolution.
 *
 * @property {(paymentsArray: PaymentP[]) => Promise<Payment>} combine
 * Combine multiple payments into one payment.
 *
 * If any of the payments is a promise, the operation will proceed upon
 * resolution.
 *
 * @property {(payment: PaymentP, paymentAmountA: Amount) => Promise<Payment[]>} split
 * Split a single payment into two payments, A and B, according to the
 * paymentAmountA passed in.
 *
 * If the payment is a promise, the operation will proceed upon resolution.
 *
 * @property {(payment: PaymentP, amounts: Amount[]) => Promise<Payment[]>} splitMany
 * Split a single payment into many payments, according to the
 * amounts passed in.
 *
 * If the payment is a promise, the operation will proceed upon resolution.

/**
 * @typedef {Object} Payment
 * Payments hold amount of digital assets of the same brand in transit. Payments can
 * be deposited in purses, split into multiple payments, combined, and
 * claimed (getting an exclusive payment). Payments are linear, meaning
 * that either a payment has the same amount of digital assets it
 * started with, or it is used up entirely. It is impossible to partially use a payment.
 *
 * Payments are often received from other actors and therefore should
 * not be trusted themselves. To get the amount of digital assets in a payment, use the
 * trusted issuer: issuer.getAmountOf(payment),
 *
 * Payments can be converted to Purses by getting a trusted issuer and
 * calling `issuer.makeEmptyPurse()` to create a purse, then `purse.deposit(payment)`.
 *
 * @property {() => Brand} getAllegedBrand
 * Get the allegedBrand, indicating the kind of digital asset this
 * payment purports to be, and which issuer to use. Because payments
 * are not trusted, any method calls on payments should be treated
 * with suspicion and verified elsewhere.
 */

/**
 * @typedef {Object} MathHelpers
 * All of the difference in how digital asset amount are manipulated can be reduced to
 * the behavior of the math on values. We extract this
 * custom logic into mathHelpers. MathHelpers are about value
 * arithmetic, whereas AmountMath is about amounts, which are the
 * values labeled with a brand. AmountMath use mathHelpers to do their value arithmetic,
 * and then brand the results, making a new amount.
 *
 * @property {(allegedValue: Value) => Value} doCoerce
 * Check the kind of this value and throw if it is not the
 * expected kind.
 *
 * @property {() => Value} doGetEmpty
 * Get the representation for the identity element (often 0 or an
 * empty array)
 *
 * @property {(value: Value) => boolean} doIsEmpty
 * Is the value the identity element?
 *
 * @property {(left: Value, right: Value) => boolean} doIsGTE
 * Is the left greater than or equal to the right?
 *
 * @property {(left: Value, right: Value) => boolean} doIsEqual
 * Does left equal right?
 *
 * @property {(left: Value, right: Value) => Value} doAdd
 * Return the left combined with the right.
 *
 * @property {(left: Value, right: Value) => Value} doSubtract
 * Return what remains after removing the right from the left. If
