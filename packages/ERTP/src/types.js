/**
 * @typedef {Object} Amount
 * Amounts are descriptions of digital assets, answering the questions
 * "how much" and "of what kind". Amounts are values labeled with a brand.
 * AmountMath executes the logic of how amounts are changed when digital
 * assets are merged, separated, or otherwise manipulated. For
 * example, a deposit of 2 bucks into a purse that already has 3 bucks
 * gives a new purse balance of 5 bucks. An empty purse has 0 bucks. AmountMath
 * relies heavily on polymorphic MathHelpers, which manipulate the unbranded
 * portion.

 * Fungible values are normally represented by natural numbers. Other

 *
 * Value must be Comparable. (Would be nice to type this correctly.)

/**
 * @typedef {Object} AmountMath
 * Logic for manipulating amounts.
 *
 * Amounts are the canonical description of tradable goods. They are manipulated
 * by issuers and mints, and represent the goods and currency carried by purses and
 * payments. They can be used to represent things like currency, stock, and the
 * abstract right to participate in a particular exchange.
 *
 * @property {() => Brand} getBrand Return the brand.
 * @property {() => AmountMathKind} getAmountMathKind
 * Get the kind of amountMath used. This can be passed as an
 * argument to `makeAmountMath` to create local amountMath.
 *
 * @property {(allegedValue: Value) => Amount} make
 * Make an amount from a value by adding the brand.
 *
 * @property {(allegedAmount: Amount) => Amount} coerce
 * Make sure this amount is valid and return it if so.
 *
 * @property {(amount: Amount) => Value} getValue
 * Extract and return the value.
 *
 * @property {() => Amount} getEmpty
 * Return the amount representing an empty amount. This is the
 * identity element for MathHelpers.add and MatHelpers.subtract.
 *
 * @property {(amount: Amount) => boolean} isEmpty
 * Return true if the Amount is empty. Otherwise false.
 *
 * @property {(leftAmount: Amount, rightAmount: Amount) => boolean} isGTE
 * Returns true if the leftAmount is greater than or equal to the
 * rightAmount. For non-scalars, "greater than or equal to" depends
 * on the kind of amount, as defined by the MathHelpers. For example,
 * whether rectangle A is greater than rectangle B depends on whether rectangle
 * A includes rectangle B as defined by the logic in MathHelpers.
 *
 * @property {(leftAmount: Amount, rightAmount: Amount) => boolean} isEqual
 * Returns true if the leftAmount equals the rightAmount. We assume
 * that if isGTE is true in both directions, isEqual is also true
 *
 * @property {(leftAmount: Amount, rightAmount: Amount) => Amount} add
 * Returns a new amount that is the union of both leftAmount and rightAmount.
 *
 * For fungible amount this means adding the values. For other kinds of
 * amount, it usually means including all of the elements from both
 * left and right.
 *
 * @property {(leftAmount: Amount, rightAmount: Amount) => Amount} subtract
 * Returns a new amount that is the leftAmount minus the rightAmount
 * (i.e. everything in the leftAmount that is not in the
 * rightAmount). If leftAmount doesn't include rightAmount
 * (subtraction results in a negative), throw  an error. Because the
 * left amount must include the right amount, this is NOT equivalent
 * to set subtraction.

 *
 * @property {() => Brand} getBrand Get the Brand for this Issuer. The Brand

 *
 * @property {(payment: PaymentP, optAmount?: Amount) => Promise<Amount>} burn
 * Burn all of the digital assets in the payment. `optAmount` is optional.
 * If `optAmount` is present, the code will insist that the amount of

 * prevent sending the wrong payment and other confusion.
 *
 * If the payment is a promise, the operation will proceed upon resolution.
 *
 * @property {(payment: PaymentP, optAmount?: Amount) => Promise<Payment>} claim
 * Transfer all digital assets from the payment to a new payment and
 * delete the original. `optAmount` is optional.
 * If `optAmount` is present, the code will insist that the amount of
 * digital assets in the payment is equal to `optAmount`, to prevent
 * sending the wrong  payment and other confusion.

 * Split a single payment into two payments, A and B, according to the

 *
 * @property {(payment: PaymentP, amounts: Amount[]) => Promise<Payment[]>} splitMany

 * Payments are often received from other actors and therefore should
 * not be trusted themselves. To get the amount of digital assets in a payment, use the
